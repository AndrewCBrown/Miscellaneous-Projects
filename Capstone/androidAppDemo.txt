This video demonstrates the Android app designed to control the locking
mechanism.
The video is a screen recording of a Google Pixle 2 running on Android Version
10. The buttons on the application are not hooked up to the server, and they
instead display a toast message at the bottom of the screen with the code that
should be sent to the server. Also, the log file is a pre-downloaded log file
from the Raspberry Pi. See LockOperator_android_documentation.txt for more
details.

The video starts off on the main page of the application, the username Andrew
is entered, and the unlock button is clicked. Next, the username John is
entered, and the lock button is clicked. Finally, the View Log button is
clicked, and the log is scrolled through. The frame returns to the main page
and the video ends.
