This video demonstrates the Raspberry Pi with the servo motor set up on a door.
The device shown is only a prototype of the real locking mechanism; the final
version would be made out of a more robust material, and it would be
permanently fixed to the studs around the door frame for stability.

In the video, the mechanism starts off in the locked position, it immediately
unlocks, and then the video pans lower so the servo motor can be seen. From
this angle the mechanism switches to the locked position again. The frame
returns to the original view and the video ends.
