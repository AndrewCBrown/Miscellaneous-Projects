Lunn is one of the oldest buildings on campus. It is home to the Registrar's office as well as the Cashier's office. This is the place where 
students would go to apply for a change of major form or to change around their class schedule. This is also where students go to pay their 
bill and get any information relating to their balance and payments at MNU.
