This is MNU's track. Though it is a bit run down, this is where the Cross Country and Track & Field teams do a lot of their training. MNU's track 
program was shut down in the early 2000's, but was recently resarted under coach Nate Wiens. Since the restart the Cross Country and Track & 
Field teams have had great success, winning multiple conference championships and doing well at Nationals most years.
