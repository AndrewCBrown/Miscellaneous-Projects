The circle drive is often the first thing a new student sees. This is where they will drop their stuff off to move into the freshman dorms. This 
drive/parking lot is just west of the middle of campus, which makes it a great spot for both students and faculty to park. At the tip of the circle (facing west) 
is the flag pole with a nice display of flowers around the base. This makes for a nice peacful entry into the campus.
