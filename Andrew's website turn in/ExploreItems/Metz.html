Metz is considered home for the Business students at MNU. Most of the main business classes meet in Metz because the Business offices are also located 
there. Metz is also used for a few general education classes as well as several math classes. The upper floor of Metz has the education department 
offices as well as several classrooms where education students will spend a lot of their time.
