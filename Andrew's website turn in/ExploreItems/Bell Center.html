Bell center is one of the newer buildings on campus, its auditorium is used for musical and theatrical productions, not only from the fine arts department 
but also for other groups who rent out the auditorium for its great acoustics. It is also the meeting place for Thursday chapels and many different classes 
including music and theater. Bell is one of the few buildings on campus that does not have a basement (except for a very small storage room at the back 
of the building).
